    <p class="bio">Hello! My name is Michael Goseco. I'm 36 year's old, from Riverside, California and I've been into
      programming ever since I was goofing around on my TI-83 back in high school. I hope to use this page as a
      demonstration of my skills as I continue to gain more knowledge in web and software development. </p>

    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p class="bio">As a child, I was very lucky in being exposed to computers at a young age. My father gave our family
      one of the first mass produced home computers: an old IBM x386. My brother and I first learned how to use a
      computer using DOS, then Windows 3.1, and so on. Despite growing up in a rural neighborhood, my elementary school
      had a computer lab ahead of its time, thanks to the efforts of a visionary teacher who would later be my 3rd
      grade teacher, Mr. Heinz. From grades 1 to 6 my class would have computer lab time in a room filled with Apple
      IIs, and even in Mr. Heinz's class there was his own lab full of Commodore 64s that gave me even more experience
      with games and command lines. I'm certain I would be a much different person today if it weren't for these chance
      influences on my life.</p>
